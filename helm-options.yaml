#The following helm options will make the bitnami/postgresql work on armv7 with the TimescaleDB plugin
#Obviously change the auth, storage, and service stuff for your needs
#It is also obvious that running as root is a bad idea, but the default user "1001" doesn't exist and this works

#helm install pg -f helm-options.yaml bitnami/postgresql
